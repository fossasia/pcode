# PSLab Experiments

## Introductory Experiments

* Do you want to measure your body resistance?
* Do you want to see brain waves?
* Which one generates electricity; an Apple or a Lime?
* Do you want to flickr an LED?
* Do you want to find where the main power lines run in your house?
* Who has the highest pitch (Female or Male)?
* How wet surfaces conduct electricity and why you should not touch any wires if the floor is wet?
* What’s the lowest frequency you can hear?
* What’s the highest frequency you can hear?
* Can you make a capacitor at home?
* Do you want to see if you bought a new battery or a used one?
* How much noise does school bell make?
