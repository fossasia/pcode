# Accelorometer


## What is an Accelorometer
Accelerometer is used to measure acceleration of a body along the X, Y and Z axis.

## Experiment for Accelorometer

### Learning Objectives
To find the acceleration of a body along different axises 
### Material Required

* You'll see three graphs for x-axis, y-axis and z-axis
* Move your device along x-axis, y-axis and z-axis

### Observation

* You'll see the acceleration of all the axis
* Acceleration is represented in numerical form as well as in graph
