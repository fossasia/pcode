*  A Full Wave Rectifier is a circuit, which converts an AC voltage into a pulsating DC voltage using both half cycles of the applied AC voltage. It uses a centre-tap transformer in this case.

* The rectified signal can be further filtered with a capacitor in order to obtain a low ripple DC voltage.

* In case a transformer is not available, the sine wave generators of the PSLab can be to the same frequency, but with 180 degree phase difference in order to behave like one.

* Two diodes are used to clip out the negative parts of both inputs, and combine them into a single output which is always in the positive region.
