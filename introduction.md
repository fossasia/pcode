What is PSLab?
------------
Pocket Science Lab (PSL) is a device which allows you to explore the world using sensors to record, analyze, and generate signals and data.

At the core is a custom circuit board containing a microprocessor which interfaces between the physical world of electronics and sensors, and the digital world of computers (such as Windows, Mac, or Linux) and even Android phones!

What can I do with PSLab?
------------
"Out of the box" PSLab can be used as an electronics workbench, with a number of built in features, including:
- Desktop low voltage power supply with 3 programmable voltage sources (+/-3.3 V,+/-5V,0-3 V)
- 4 channel oscilloscope with software selectable amplification stages
- Multimeter functions including voltmeter and capacitance measurement
- Digital and analog function generators
- 4 channel logic analyzer

In addition, PSLab has several interfaces through which it can work with programmable sensors
- I2C, SPI, UART data buses
- Digital and analog I/O
- Advanced Plugins/Add-on Modules
- Support for acceleration/gyroscopes/humidity/temperature modules, etc.

See the [product specifications page](https://pslab.io/specifications/) and [datasheet](https://pslab.io/wp-content/uploads/PSLab-Data-Sheet.pdf) for more information on features.
