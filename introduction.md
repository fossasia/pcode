These instructions will help get you started using the Pocket Science Lab
(PSLab) hardware and applications.

| **WARNING**: Do not use PSLab with high voltage circuits, in hazardous environments, or without appropriate supervision!  |

## What is PSLab?

Pocket Science Lab (PSLab) is a device which allows you to explore the world
using sensors to record, analyze, and generate signals and data.

At the core is a custom circuit board containing a [PIC24
microcontroller](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC24EP256GP204) which
interfaces between the physical world of electronics and sensors, and the
digital world of computers (running operating systems such as Windows, macOS, or
Linux) and even Android phones!

## What can I do with PSLab?

"Out of the box" PSLab can be used as an electronics workbench, with a number of
built in features, including:

- Desktop low voltage power supply with 3 programmable voltage sources (+/-3.3 V,+/-5V,0-3 V)
- 3 channel[^1] oscilloscope with software selectable amplification stages
- Multimeter functions including voltmeter and capacitance measurement
- Digital and analog function generators
- 4 channel logic analyzer

[^1]: Restrictions on the third channel:
    1. Limited CH3 range: -3.3V to 3.3V; CH1 and CH2 range from -16.5V to 16.5V
    2. Lack of (software selectable) gain

In addition, PSLab has several interfaces through which it can work with
programmable sensors:

- I2C, SPI, UART data buses
- Digital and analog I/O
- Advanced Plugins/Add-on Modules
- Support for acceleration/gyroscopes/humidity/temperature modules, etc.

See the [product specifications page](https://pslab.io/specifications/) and
[datasheet](https://pslab.io/wp-content/uploads/PSLab-Data-Sheet.pdf) for more
information on features.

## Entire stack

The full stack for use on desktop computers is described in this diagram:
