### Dependence of drain current on D-S voltage, and Gate Voltage

* Set the gate voltage for various values between 0, and -2 V , and observe the effect on saturation current

* PV1 is varied in steps, and for each step the current is calculated from the difference between voltages at PV1 and CH1, and the known value of the resistor(560 ohms)

* Acquired plots can be selectively displayed or deleted.
