* Make the connections as shown in the figure.

* Select a voltage at PV2, for setting base current. This voltage, in combination with the 200K series resistor acts as a passive constant current source.

* The Collector voltage and current are measured by the program and plotted in real time.

* An ammeter is not shown , but current is calculated using the measured voltage drop across the known resistor. I = (PV1-CH1)/1k
