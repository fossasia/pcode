#### DC Summing junction

* Make the Connections as shown in the figure.

* Use PV2, and PV3 as inputs. Connect them to CH2, CH3 to also simultaneously monitor them.

* Monitor the output via CH1, and verify that V(CH1) = -(v1*(rf/r1)+v2*(rf/r2)), where

rf = feedback resistor
rf = input resistor
v1 = V(PV2)
v2 = V(PV3)

#### AC Summing

* Make the Connections as shown in the figure.
* Use W1, and W2 as inputs. Connect them to CH2, CH3 to also simultaneously monitor them.
* Monitor the output via CH1
* Make the waveforms 180 out of phase, and check that they cancel each other out if the input amplitudes are equal

* Observe various summing ratios by changing the input resistor values.
