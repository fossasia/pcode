* Make the Connections as shown in the figure.

* CH1 monitors the original waveform output from W1.

* CH2 monitors the filter's output .

* Set the frequency range to study the behaviour in, and click on START .

* The app then outputs a sine wave with an incrementing frequency on W1 which is connected to the input of the circuit under test.

* The amplitudes and phases of the input and output waveforms are recorded for each frequency in order to obtain the bode plots.
