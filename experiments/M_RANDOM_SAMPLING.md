Random Sampling
---

### Study the probability distributions of waveforms

#### Introduction

* In this experiment, we will measure voltages of an input signal at random intervals, and plot a histogram that shows the time spent in each amplitude range.

* For example, a sine wave spends maximum time at its extremities, so the histogram will have the highest peaks at either end, and the lowest ones near the mean.

* Connect W1 to CH1, and run the experiment to characterize a sine/triangular wave, and then connect SQR1 to characterize a square wave
