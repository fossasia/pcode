Light Dependent Resistor
---

* An LDR is a two pin device whose resistance decreases with the intensity of light falling on it.

* Record 50Hz fluctuations caused by flourescent lighting.

* Set up the device in a room with flourescent lighting, and observe that the plot fluctuates slightly. Zoom in along the vertical axis by scrolling on the yaxis at the level of the plot

* Now pause the data updates, and use the crosshairs to calculate the time period of the fluctuations. Confirm that they correspond to the power line frequency.
	
### Testing with a flickering LED

* Repeat the same with an LED connected between SQR1 and GND. Set the frequency , and point it towards the LDR.

* Measure the time period again, and confirm that it corresponds to the frequency of SQR1 that was set.
