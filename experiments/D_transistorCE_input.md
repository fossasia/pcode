* Make the connections as shown in the figure
* Select a voltage at PV1, for setting collector voltage.
* For various equally spaced voltages in the specified range, the base current is measured as a function of base voltage(measured by CH3).
* An ammeter is not shown , but base current is calculated using the measured voltage drop across the known resistor. I = (PV2-CH3)/200k
