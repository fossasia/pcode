Bandwidth Characterization of a piezo buzzer
---

* Connect W1 to the buzzer's +ve wire, as well as CH2 for monitoring the original waveform
* Connect a microphone to MIC, and put about ten cms gap between the buzzer and microphone
* Set the frequency range to study the behaviour in, and click on START 
* In case the MIC output starts clipping(flattened peaks) around the peak amplitude, decrease buzzer volumne using the amplitude knob
