### Elementary experiments with resistors

#### Study how resistors behave in combination

Measure the values of the resistors by individually connecting them between SEN and GND, and note these.

#### In Series

Connect the two resistors in series as shown below, and observe the combined resistance. Rtotal = R1+R2

#### In Parallel

Now connect them in parallel, and confirm that
