* Make the Connections as shown in the figure.
* CH1 monitors the original waveform output from W1.
* CH2 monitors the filtered waveform.
* PV3 is used as the voltage source that controls the roll-off frequency. It must be set to a minimum of 500mV.
* The roll-off frequency increases with PV3.
* Select the frequency range over which to study this circuit ( 10-1000Hz ) is adequate, and click on start.
