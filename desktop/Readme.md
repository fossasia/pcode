If you are running Windows and having issues, please have a look at [this
thread](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-documentation/pull/119). Some of the
information regarding PSLab specifically may no longer apply, but the general
approaches still hold.

## Using the app

Note: In order to use an actual PSLab device, you will need to have the [Python
library](../python-library) installed.

First *connect the PSLab board and your PC with a USB cable*. Then open the app.

You will be presented with a home screen like this:
